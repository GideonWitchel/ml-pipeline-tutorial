    "### What is Jupyter Notebook?\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook is a piece of software for easily integrating markdown instructions and \"code cells\" which can execute python code. Jupyter notebook files (like the one you are currently reading) are orgnized into cells, which are segments of text. Cells can be markdown, python, or other languages. Each cell is interpreted by its respective compiler / interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are relatively straightforward. Write text in markdown, and then render it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python cells are a little more complicated. Python cells contain code. You can run the cells in a document in any order. Jupyter Notebook caches data for cells in a document, so if you set a viarable in one cell (or import a module in one cell), that will be accessible in all other cells. Sometimes the data gets deleted, at which point you should re-run the cell when generated its value.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Jupyer notebooks are JSON files in their underlying implementation, but they are made pretty by the software which displays them. It is nice to open Jupyter notebooks with VS Code, because VS code has extensions which allow easy display and interaction with Jupyter Notebook files. You can identify a Jupyter Notebook file by its file extension: .ipynb"
