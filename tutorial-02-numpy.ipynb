    "### What is Numpy?\n",
    "Numpy is a python library for managing big data. Big data is just large sets of data. Python is a scripting language designed to be easily written. Because of this, underlying data storage is very innefficient. When storing and manipulating large quantities of data, this can become a problem; execution takes a long time and requiers hundreds of gigabytes (if not terabytes) of memory. Numpy is a solution which stores data in optimized arrays, while still providing a simple interface for interaction and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an array?\n",
    "An array is a list of data. Arrays have 'dimensions', which are similar to dimensions in math. A 1 dimensional (1D) array has numbers in a line. This looks like [0,1,2,3,4]. A 2 dimensional (2D) array has numbers in a plane. This looks like: [[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4], [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]. The beauty of numpy is n-dimensional arrays. While it becomes hard to visualize, numpy allows 3D, 4D, or 99D arrays. This is useful for complex algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array shape\n",
    "Array shape is just a way of representing the size of the array in all of its dimensions. For the example 2D array above, it has a shape of (3,5), because it is a 3 row by 5 column array. A 3D array's shape would have 3 numbers, and so on."

    "### Manipulating arrays\n",
    "Numpy arrays are manipulated in the same way that regular arrays are manipulated: with [index]. For numpy, multiple dimensions are defined within the brackets, not as new brackets. For example, [row,col] will access a specific value in a 2D array. To get an entire row [row] works. That is a simplified syntax, though. In reality, numpy is reading [row,:], which means row and all columns (':' represents all). To get a column, the access is [:,col]. The entire synyax is [row_start:row_end,col_start:col_end]. This can expand with more dimensions and more commas."
